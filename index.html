        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>        I'm a entreprenaur, that is now interrested in a career in the develpment. The main reason i want to enter the tech world is due to the opportunity's in the tech world. I want to learn as much as possible to keep growing and one day to have a tech company.

        <p>I've started in the military and after I left service I wanted to have something of my own. I started working as a security officer and 1 year after that. I stated my own company. It whas not easy I had to work very hard. It taught me that as long as you work hard and educate yourself as much as possible, you can do great things.</p>

        <p>I'd like to have a big career in the tech world. My dream is to work for big companys but living in south america.
          the main reason I'm interrested in tech is the freedom you have to work from wherever you want and for me is it in latin America.
          My whole familie is over there so it would be great to live there with them.
